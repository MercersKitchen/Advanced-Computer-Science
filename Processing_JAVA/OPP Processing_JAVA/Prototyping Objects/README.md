# Prototyping Object Ideas
Prototyping Specific to Pong

**Purpose**: learning how to prototype (Pong Ball) in OOP while being creative with what it represents
- Ways of thinking about an ellipse in code
  - Firework
  - Sparkler in a glass
  - Simple Chase Game

- "What are you able to code when your imagination experiences all these metaphors for a pong ball?"

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

These Programs illustrate
- way for many pong balls to occur on the screen
  - need rules for when additional balls are created
- ball will bound on the table and go in a different direction
  - similar to the mouseClick'ed target element of "Bouncing Ball"

Order of these programs ...
1. Teaching Examples: Students work on basic program, other algorithms
- Moving Ball: improved algorithm using updated understanding of slope (m =! 1)
- Many Ball: edge detection algorithm (simple one outside of class given) & overlap algorithm (based on searching algorithm, to be taught?)
- MovingMany_Combination: creating black holes in Knight Time Skies or "Running Towards a Point"

2. Student Assignment Example, guided
- Fireworks: example code developed with students

# Summary of Each Program, see above, TBA

Note: to introduce objects, it is best if students suggest what is below
- Modularity in OOP means a non-linear programming style
- These reflections start with a case study or a decomposed problem of Fireworks
- "How do you recreate a firework but in steps?"
- "What needs to be coded first, etc."

This blends an Object-first approach with end-user case studies.

## Moving Ball

Start with putting a ball on the screen with ellipse()

Explore a chasing game

## Many Ball

Start with putting a ball on the screen with ellipse()
- Explore the parameters needed - these are the variables of the object
- Explore creating the ball anywhere
- Add access modifiers, etc. (see specific ReadMe files in various folders)

## MovingMany_Combination

## Fireworks

# Ideas to Include
Debug the following issues of the programs
- ellipse half off the screen
- no layering of pong balls
- minimum start diameter so we can see it?
