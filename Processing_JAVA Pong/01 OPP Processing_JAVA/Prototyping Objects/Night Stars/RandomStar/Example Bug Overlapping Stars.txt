If a star is close enough, including the radii, to it's neighbour, including it's radius
Then these will overlap

Overlapping is a 2-D problem: circle area overlaps with other circle area
- inequalities problem of circle equation

Overlapping is a 1-D Problem
- line bwteeen two star centers
- find midpoint
- if radii of either circle is greater than midpoint, then overlapp
- change "greater than radius" to midpoint length so at least tangent
