# Review Processing-Java
From Structured to Procedural

Completed Project Exemplar - <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Advanced-Computer-Science/tree/master/Processing_JAVA%20Pong/00%20Processing%20Review/01%20Reviewing%20Procedural%20for%20Pong/ProStart">
Pong</a>

Concepts and Vocabulary Summary
- Pong Case Study: GUI & End-user, experienced features, expectations
  - Chart for GUI Ratios and factions of objects in GUI (ball, paddle x 2, scoreboard x 2)
  - Grouping Features within object
  - Populating Variables based on display geometry and coordinate plane (X | Y | width | height)
- Variables: Naming, Camel Casing, Declaration, Population (Defining)
- Variables related to functions and parameters, with Casting, and using the debugging window
  - void, returning
- Using console to view arithmetic and where objects are
- Using tools like color selector, etc.

Progression for Case Study and Procedural Review
- Pong Case Study: GUI & End-user, experienced features, expectations, <a href="">see below</a>
  - See Computer Science Planning, Projects
- Procedural Features
  - Reminder: Canvas must be "clicked with the mouse first" for OS, then the Game Entered
  - Accessing display geometry
  - Using coordinate plane as ratios or percent of geometry
  - Questioning geometry as landscape vs. portrait with feedback to console or splash screen
  - Creating a Splash Screen with instructions
  - Start Button: playing pong beginning
  - Quit Button with hover over feature (see https://github.com/QEHS-ProcessingJava/Pong-Procedural/tree/master/Pong)
  - Text Calculator as a procedural return (introducing Pure Java OPP Mathematical data returns to driver, and data interactions between objects)
  - Sound files
  - Image files (Currently no images loaded but illustrated in a TAB)
- Advanced Procedural Features (Not illustrated until Object Oriented Programming Section)
  - Note: these features require advanced planning, not prototyping
  - Dark-Light Mode Switch (similar to Quit Button Hover Over Feature)
  - Reset Game Button (similar to Splash Screen, resetting variables and redrawing start screen)
  - Saving game state by reading and writing .txt files
  - Creating AI for Single Player Play
  - Moving ball start position and randomly choosing the direction

Progression for Object Orientated Progressions
- UNDER CONSTRUCTION (include AP CSA & CSP)
- See OOP Parts & Summary
- See Prototyping Objects
- Incorporate them back into Pong

Possible Ideas to incorporate
- Random Ball Start
- Faster Ball, Guards
- Shrinking Paddle
- Easter Egg of catching ball
- Rally Counter influencing score
- Other features of older pong games

Advanced Features Idea List
- "Evening out play when score is not close"
  - Making ball faster
  - Slowing paddle speed

---

# Pong Case Study
- Create student activity for this case study
- include percents or ratio guesses (remember, compiler verifies guess easily)

Mandatory GUI Objects
- Ball
- Left and Right Paddles
- Score Board
- Space for Buttons

# Trivia Notes about Processing-Java

Processing-Java uses the Java Compiler

Requirements
- Processing-Java file must be within Folder, named the same
- .pde extension adds a few requirements to the Processing-Java Execution

Other Notes
- ByteCode automatically created
- Main Processing-Java Program is the Constructor (in Object Orientated Programming)
- Java Compiler is run with specific main line "void main string args ()"

---

# To Include

Add all Advanced Placement Vocabulary in summary and Explanations in Details

Use Console to get variables to have numbers (verify the math)

- Creating a ball & Moving the Ball (local and global variables, declaring and populating variables, casting based on function expectations)
- ?

Bounce Code
Explain the math and if statement for one bounce,
Question: create the next 3 bounces

if (  ballMoveX <= 0+ballSize/2 || ballMoveX >= width-ballSize/2 ) {
    speedX = speedX * -1;
  }
  if ( ballMoveY <= 0+ballSize/2 || ballMoveY >= height-ballSize/2 ) {
    speedY = speedY * -1;
  }

Trivial Knowledge: program creates a cross-stich pattern

- Global vs. local variables: declare, populate, multiple operations
- Linear execution (when does the computer know the displayWidth & displayHeight
- Casting, "how to know the type of variables needed" (answer, know the function you need for the variable

Laying, get rid of the shadow

---

Code to add
- create sections and code to add when coding specific ideas
- might help with ignoring some code and doing other things
- another idea is to create tabs to section blocks of in a linear way

---

Grading to consider
- Random Ball Start from 4 courners
- Faster Ball / Guards
- Shrinking Paddles
- Easter Egg of Catching ball in paddle
- Rally Counter and score based on that

- Review Procedural Design, writing a driver program with supporting files
- Protypting Text to Procedural Text Autoformatting
  - Review all functions needed to print text to canvas in processing (language is for visual data, text data has difficulties; "tool must match problem to be solved")
  See Text_Flat.pde
  - Note: changing the number based on educated guesses is something a computer should be able to do
  - Unique Flowchart for putting text in a rect()
- Including Text in Pong Procedural Game
  - Modular Programming - makes changes easier, based on GUI Objects, groups of code, or repeated code

## After Prototyping Objects
- Pong pseudo-code
- Complete small class design examples, then apply to Pong pseudo-code
- Review O_Pong_Exemplars

Class Design Hierarchy Examples Order: see ReadMe there

# To Delete Once Programs read like Text

# CreateBall.pde: Creating and Moving the Ball

```JAVA
  //Global Variables
  float ballStartPositionX; // displayWidth
  float ballStartPositionY; // displayHeight
  float ballSize ; // displayWidth
  int ballMoveX; // Declaration
  int ballMoveY; // Declaration
```

```JAVA
void setup() {

  //Populating the global variables with display geometry
  size (700, 500); // fullScreen(); Cannot Teach with fullScreen()
  ballStartPositionX = width*1/2; // displayWidth
  ballStartPositionY = height*1/2; // displayHeight
  ballSize = width*1/128; // displayWidth
  ballMoveX = int (ballStartPositionX); //Populate, Example of Casting
  ballMoveY = int (ballStartPositionY); //Populate, Example of Casting
}

// Create a Ball, start position
ellipse (ballStartPositionX, ballStartPositionY, ballSize, ballSize);

```

```JAVA
void draw() {

  // Move the Ball
  println ("X Start:", ballStartPositionX, "Y Start:", ballStartPositionY);
  println ("X Move:", ballMoveX, "Y Move:", ballMoveY);
  ballMoveX += 1; // Progression of ballMoveX=ballMoveX+1 to ballMoveX=+1 to ...
  ballMoveY -= 1; //What is the difference in these lines
  println ("X Move:", ballMoveX);
  println ("Y Move :", ballMoveY);

  // Moved Position
  ellipse (ballMoveX, ballMoveY, ballSize, ballSize);

  //Note: Image retains shadows and ball doesn't bounce
}

# BounceBall.pde: Making the Ball Bounce all playing area

Note: order of additional lines of code are important
- Remember: execution occurs one line at a time, in order

```JAVA
  //Global Variables
  int speedX = 1; // Follows rules of physics
  int speedY = 1; // Follows rules of physics
```

```JAVA
void setup() {
}
```

```JAVA
void draw() {

  //Value Testing and Arithmetic to Position Ball
  if (  ballMoveX <= 0+ballSize/2 || ballMoveX >= width-ballSize/2 ) {
    speedX = speedX * -1;
  }
  if ( ballMoveY <= 0+ballSize/2 || ballMoveY >= height-ballSize/2 ) {
    speedY = speedY * -1;

  // Move the Ball, using Value Testing and Arithmetic
  // Drawing the Canvas Objects
