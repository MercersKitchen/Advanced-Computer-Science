See Basic Program

Lesson 1
- review Java Compiler finding first line of program
- build flat addition of two numbers
- build println()
- might need to clarify this class is unique and requires different constructor than 
  Processing-Java
- build addNum()
- build divideNum(), include formatting, notice change from float to double as basic
  floating decimal variable
- introduce IOException, divide by zero as infinity, import java.io.* (wild card)
- build Try-Catch, review execution of lines especially in Try (gives decision options)

Lesson 2
- Switch to args[] as input
- Must to parsing (strings to ???, creates algorithm if using try-catch
- Checking args[] to see if populated
- System.exit(0) and System.exit(1)

Lesson 3, using ARGS[]
- Parsing from Strings to integers, longs, floats, doubles, Booleans, and to strings at end
- For Submission to Mr. Mercer
  Combine empty args[] try-catch, so I can simply run the program

Lesson 4: using JOptionPane or Scanner as input to program, instead of ARGS[]
- Same lessons work here

Lesson 5: using Strings Functions to develop Chatbot


Note: see Parsing Method String to see where these lessons are going
